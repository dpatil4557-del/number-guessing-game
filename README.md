Number Guessing Game 

Description
The Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based game where the computer generates a random number, and the player tries to guess it. The game provides hints such as whether the guessed number is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

Features
Random number generation
User input for guessing numbers
Hints for each guess (Too High / Too Low)
Counts the number of attempts
Easy to understand and play


How the Game Works
The computer generates a random number within a given range (for example, 1 to 100).
The player enters a number as a guess.
The program checks the guess:
If the guess is too high, it shows "Too High".
If the guess is too low, it shows "Too Low".
The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
After guessing correctly, the total number of attempts is displayed.
